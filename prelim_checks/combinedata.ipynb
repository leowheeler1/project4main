You can miss your period for a number of reasons — including pregnancy, stress, or a change in diet or exercise habits — but it's best to get evaluated whenever your menstrual cycle changes. Even if you don't mind not having periods, it's advisable to see your provider to find out what's causing the change.

Common symptoms include having trouble with:  Reading, spelling or math. Driving. Getting dressed. Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still. Judging how far away objects are. Using everyday objects or tools. Identifying left from right.  Other common symptoms include:  Anxiety. Confusion. Changes in behavior and personality.  Memory problems may occur later in the disease. Causes The most common cause of posterior cortical atrophy is a form of Alzheimer's disease that's not typical. It affects the back of the brain. Other less common causes include corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Researchers are looking at potential gene variations that may be related to the condition.

Examples of auras include:  A sudden sense of unprovoked fear or joy A deja vu experience — a feeling that what's happening has happened before A sudden or strange odor or taste A rising sensation in the abdomen, similar to being on a roller coaster  Sometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms include:  Loss of awareness of surroundings Staring Lip smacking Repeated swallowing or chewing Unusual finger movements, such as picking motions  After a temporal lobe seizure, you may have:  A period of confusion and difficulty speaking Inability to recall what occurred during the seizure Unawareness of having had a seizure Extreme sleepiness  In extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure — featuring convulsions and loss of consciousness.</td>\n",

They include:  Irregular or skipped periods, which might be present for years or develop after a pregnancy or after stopping birth control pills Difficulty getting pregnant Hot flashes Night sweats Vaginal dryness Dry eyes Irritability or difficulty concentrating Decreased sexual desire  When to see a health care provider If you've missed your period for three months or more, see your health care provider to determine the cause. You can miss your period for a number of reasons — including pregnancy, stress, or a change in diet or exercise habits — but it's best to get evaluated whenever your menstrual cycle changes. Even if you don't mind not having periods, it's advisable to see your provider to find out what's causing the change. Low estrogen levels can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of heart disease.   \n",

They tend to gradually get worse. Common symptoms include having trouble with:  Reading, spelling or math. Driving. Getting dressed. Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still. Judging how far away objects are. Using everyday objects or tools. Identifying left from right.  Other common symptoms include:  Anxiety. Confusion. Changes in behavior and personality.  Memory problems may occur later in the disease. Causes The most common cause of posterior cortical atrophy is a form of Alzheimer's disease that's not typical. It affects the back of the brain. Other less common causes include corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Researchers are looking at potential gene variations that may be related to the condition. Risk factors Further study is needed to determine whether the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease may play a role in posterior cortical atrophy.

       "9   An unusual sensation (aura) may precede a temporal lobe seizure, acting as a warning. Not everyone who has temporal lobe seizures has auras, and not everyone who has auras remembers them. The aura is actually the first part of a focal seizure before consciousness is impaired. Examples of auras include:  A sudden sense of unprovoked fear or joy A deja vu experience — a feeling that what's happening has happened before A sudden or strange odor or taste A rising sensation in the abdomen, similar to being on a roller coaster  Sometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms include:  Loss of awareness of surroundings Staring Lip smacking Repeated swallowing or chewing Unusual finger movements, such as picking motions  After a temporal lobe seizure, you may have:  A period of confusion and difficulty speaking Inability to recall what occurred during the seizure Unawareness of having had a seizure Extreme sleepiness  In extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure — featuring convulsions and loss of consciousness.   \n",

You might seem fine after a head injury. This period is called the lucid interval. Over time, pressure on your brain increases, producing some or all of the following signs and symptoms:  Headache that gets worse Vomiting Drowsiness and progressive loss of consciousness Dizziness Confusion Unequal pupil size Slurred speech Loss of movement (paralysis) on the opposite side of the body from the head injury  As more blood fills your brain or the narrow space between your brain and skull, other signs and symptoms may appear, such as:  Lethargy Seizures Unconsciousness    \n",

X-linked agammaglobulinemia is caused by a genetic mutation. People with the condition can't produce antibodies that fight infection. About 40% of people with the condition have a family member who has it. Complications People with XLA can live relatively normal lives and should be encouraged to participate in regular activities for their ages. However, recurrent infections related to XLA will likely require careful attention and aggressive treatment. They can cause organ damage and be life-threatening.

       "      <td>The most common symptom associated with the yips is an involuntary muscle jerk, although some people experience tremors, twitches, spasms or freezing. Causes In some people, the yips are a type of focal dystonia, a condition that causes involuntary muscle contractions during a specific task. It's most likely related to overuse of a certain set of muscles, similar to writer's cramp. Anxiety worsens the effect. Some athletes become so anxious and self-focused — overthinking to the point of distraction — that their ability to execute a skill, such as putting, is impaired. \"Choking\" is an extreme form of performance anxiety that may compromise a golfer's or any athlete's game.

       "2806  Babies with XLA generally appear healthy for the first few months because they're protected by the antibodies they got from their mothers before birth. When these antibodies clear from their systems, the babies begin to develop often severe, recurrent bacterial infections — such as of the ears, lungs, sinuses and skin — that can be life-threating.

X-linked agammaglobulinemia is caused by a genetic mutation. People with the condition can't produce antibodies that fight infection. About 40% of people with the condition have a family member who has it. Complications People with XLA can live relatively normal lives and should be encouraged to participate in regular activities for their ages. However, recurrent infections related to XLA will likely require careful attention and aggressive treatment. They can cause organ damage and be life-threatening.

Causes In some people, the yips are a type of focal dystonia, a condition that causes involuntary muscle contractions during a specific task. It's most likely related to overuse of a certain set of muscles, similar to writer's cramp. Anxiety worsens the effect. Some athletes become so anxious and self-focused — overthinking to the point of distraction — that their ability to execute a skill, such as putting, is impaired. \"Choking\" is an extreme form of performance anxiety that may compromise a golfer's or any athlete's game.
