They include:  Irregular or skipped periods, which might be present for years or develop after a pregnancy or after stopping birth control pills Difficulty getting pregnant Hot flashes Night sweats Vaginal dryness Dry eyes Irritability or difficulty concentrating Decreased sexual desire  When to see a health care provider If you've missed your period for three months or more, see your health care provider to determine the cause. You can miss your period for a number of reasons — including pregnancy, stress, or a change in diet or exercise habits — but it's best to get evaluated whenever your menstrual cycle changes. Even if you don't mind not having periods, it's advisable to see your provider to find out what's causing the change. Low estrogen levels can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of heart disease.",

Common symptoms include having trouble with:  Reading, spelling or math. Driving. Getting dressed. Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still. Judging how far away objects are. Using everyday objects or tools. Identifying left from right.  Other common symptoms include:  Anxiety. Confusion. Changes in behavior and personality.  Memory problems may occur later in the disease. Causes The most common cause of posterior cortical atrophy is a form of Alzheimer's disease that's not typical. It affects the back of the brain. Other less common causes include corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Researchers are looking at potential gene variations that may be related to the condition.

The aura is actually the first part of a focal seizure before consciousness is impaired. Examples of auras include:  A sudden sense of unprovoked fear or joy A deja vu experience — a feeling that what's happening has happened before A sudden or strange odor or taste A rising sensation in the abdomen, similar to being on a roller coaster  Sometimes temporal lobe seizures impair your ability to respond to others. This type of temporal lobe seizure usually lasts 30 seconds to two minutes. Characteristic signs and symptoms include:  Loss of awareness of surroundings Staring Lip smacking Repeated swallowing or chewing Unusual finger movements, such as picking motions  After a temporal lobe seizure, you may have:  A period of confusion and difficulty speaking Inability to recall what occurred during the seizure Unawareness of having had a seizure Extreme sleepiness  In extreme cases, what starts as a temporal lobe seizure evolves into a generalized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure — featuring convulsions and loss of consciousness.",

It starts as a flat red mark anywhere on the body, most often on the face, scalp, chest or back. Usually a child has only one mark. Some children may have more than one, particularly if they're part of a multiple birth. During your child's first year, the red mark grows rapidly into a spongy, rubbery-looking bump that sticks out from the skin. The hemangioma then enters a rest phase and, eventually, it begins to slowly disappear. Many hemangiomas disappear by age 5, and most are gone by age 10.
